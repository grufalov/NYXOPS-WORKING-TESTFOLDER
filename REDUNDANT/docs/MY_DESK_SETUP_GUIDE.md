# My Desk - Setup Instructions

## Database Setup

### 1. Run the Migration

Execute the following SQL script in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of migrations/20250910_create_my_desk_tables.sql
```

**Location**: `migrations/20250910_create_my_desk_tables.sql`

This will create all necessary tables, indexes, RLS policies, and helper functions for My Desk.

### 2. Verify Tables Created

After running the migration, verify these tables exist in your Supabase database:

- ‚úÖ `my_desk_checklist` - Daily checklist items
- ‚úÖ `my_desk_tasks` - Personal task management  
- ‚úÖ `my_desk_notes` - Scratchpad notes with Markdown
- ‚úÖ `my_desk_quick_capture` - Quick text captures
- ‚úÖ `my_desk_settings` - User settings and PIN storage

### 3. Test the Installation

1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to "My Desk" in the sidebar

3. Set up a PIN when prompted (4-6 digits)

4. Test each section:
   - ‚úÖ Morning Checklist - Add/complete items
   - ‚úÖ Quick Capture - Type notes, convert to tasks
   - ‚úÖ Personal Notes - Markdown editing with toolbar
   - ‚úÖ Task List - Create/edit/delete tasks with priorities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **PIN Issues**
   - Use the "Reset PIN" option in the authentication modal
   - Clear browser session storage if needed
   - Check browser console for authentication errors

2. **Data Not Saving**
   - Verify internet connection
   - Check Supabase connection status
   - Review browser console for API errors
   - Ensure RLS policies are correctly applied

3. **Task Limit Warnings**
   - Complete old tasks to free up space
   - Delete unnecessary tasks from trash bin
   - Use bulk operations to manage large numbers of tasks

4. **Mobile View Issues**
   - Refresh page if tabs don't switch properly
   - Check responsive breakpoints in browser dev tools
   - Ensure touch events are working correctly

### Database Verification

Run these queries in Supabase SQL Editor to verify setup:

```sql
-- Check if tables exist
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename LIKE 'my_desk_%';

-- Check RLS policies
SELECT tablename, policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename LIKE 'my_desk_%';

-- Test helper function
SELECT get_user_active_task_count('your-user-id-here');
```

### Performance Monitoring

Monitor these metrics in Supabase:

- Query performance for My Desk tables
- Database storage usage
- API request patterns
- User authentication success rates

## Feature Flags

The My Desk feature is automatically enabled once the database migration is complete. No additional feature flags are required.

## Migration Rollback (If Needed)

To remove My Desk completely:

```sql
-- WARNING: This will permanently delete all My Desk data
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS my_desk_checklist CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS my_desk_tasks CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS my_desk_notes CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS my_desk_quick_capture CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS my_desk_settings CASCADE;

-- Remove helper functions
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_user_active_task_count(UUID);
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS check_user_task_limit(UUID);
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS cleanup_old_deleted_tasks();
```

## Next Steps

1. **User Testing**: Have team members test the PIN setup and basic functionality
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Watch for any database performance issues
3. **User Feedback**: Collect feedback on the interface and features
4. **Data Backup**: Ensure My Desk data is included in backup strategies

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify Supabase connection and table structure
3. Review the implementation files for debugging
4. Test with different user accounts to isolate issues

The My Desk feature is now fully implemented and ready for use! üéâ
