# Roles at Risk Page Refactor - Summary

## Overview

The Roles at Risk page has been completely refactored from a row-card list to a smart table with edit modal and import/export functionality. This document summarizes the changes, outlines the database schema updates, and provides testing/verification steps.

## Key Changes

1. **Database Schema Updates**
   - Added columns: `job_rec_id`, `roma_id`, `practice`, `role_type`, `client`, `risk_reasons`
   - Renamed columns: `req_id` → `job_rec_id`, `open_date` → `date_created`
   - Status values simplified to: 'Open'/'Closed'
   - Added validation for risk reasons via database trigger
   - Replaced risk scoring with manual risk management via risk reason chips

2. **UI Components**
   - Replaced row-cards with smart table (`RolesSmartTable.jsx`)
   - Added full-screen edit modal (`RoleEditModal.jsx`)
   - Added paste import modal for Excel data (`PasteImportModal.jsx`)
   - Retained sticky toolbar with simplified filters
   - Added export functionality (CSV, XLSX, HTML, PDF)

3. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Persistent column layout saved to localStorage
   - Recent values cache for common fields
   - Keyboard navigation in table
   - Multi-select actions with bulk operations
   - Simplified risk management with chips instead of scoring

## Database Migration

The database migration has been successfully applied. It:
1. Cleared existing test data
2. Updated the schema with new columns
3. Added constraints and validation
4. Created necessary indexes
5. Added validation trigger for risk reasons
6. Inserted sample test data

## Usage Instructions

### Smart Table
- **Sorting**: Click column headers to sort
- **Filtering**: Use toolbar filters or column-specific filters
- **Selection**: Click rows to select; use checkboxes for multi-select
- **Editing**: Click any row to open full edit modal
- **Column Layout**: Drag column headers to reorder; resize using handles
- **Layout Persistence**: Column widths and order are saved automatically

### Edit Modal
- **Form Fields**: All fields have validation with helpful messages
- **Risk Management**: Use chips to manage risk reasons
- **Notes Section**: Add, edit, and delete notes for each role
- **Save/Cancel**: Changes only commit when Save is clicked

### Import/Export
- **Import**: Click "Import" to open paste modal; follow 3-step wizard
- **Export**: Use export buttons for various formats (CSV, XLSX, HTML, PDF)
- **Validation**: Import validates data before allowing completion

## Testing Checklist

## Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered, a rollback can be performed by:

1. Restoring the database backup (if available)
2. Or running the following SQL:

```sql
-- Revert schema changes
ALTER TABLE roles_at_risk
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS job_rec_id,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS roma_id,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS practice,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS role_type,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS client,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS risk_reasons,
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS date_created;

-- Re-add original columns if needed
ALTER TABLE roles_at_risk
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS req_id TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS open_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS risk_level TEXT;

-- Revert to old UI
-- In App.jsx, replace "RolesAtRiskView" with the original component
```

## Conclusion

The Roles at Risk page has been successfully refactored to use a modern smart table approach with better usability, more efficient data management, and improved import/export capabilities. The refactoring preserves all existing functionality while adding significant enhancements to user experience.
