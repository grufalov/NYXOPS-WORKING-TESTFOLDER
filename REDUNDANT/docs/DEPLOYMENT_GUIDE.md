## 📁 What to Upload to Netlify

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
If you have Netlify CLI installed (which you do), use:
```bash
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

### Option 2: Manual Upload
If uploading manually through Netlify dashboard:
1. **Upload the ENTIRE `dist` folder contents** (not the folder itself)
2. **Required files in dist folder:**
   ```
   dist/
   ├── index.html
   ├── assets/
   │   ├── index-[hash].js
   │   └── index-[hash].css
   └── vite.svg
   ```

## 🔧 Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in your Netlify dashboard:
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` = Your Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = Your Supabase anon key
